				<h1>Solar Eclipse</h1>
				<h2>by Drew Worden & Kevin Quizhpi</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to an interactive, 3-dimensional representation of a solar eclipse. You can scroll in out and pan, orbiting the Earth. In order to get a good view of the eclipse you can
					scroll all the way into the Earth and face the Sun. You can also track the Moon and its journey around the Earth, watching as it moves through its phases.
